    "\n",
    "This Lab exercise will guide you through an example of using a machine learning (ML) algorithm to train a model for intrusion detection. You have been provided with this Notebook with markdown explanations & code used in this example, and a custom dataset that has been extracted from the NBaIoT dataset provided by UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided dataset has labelled samples from benign traffic generated by a security camera (SimpleHome XCs7-1003-WHT) as well as traces when this camera is infected with Mirai botnet to launch a TCP SYN flooding attack. There are 115 features with one target class in the dataset. Details are in the following paper. \n",
